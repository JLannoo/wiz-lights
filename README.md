# Wiz Lights
## WIP
A Rust library for controlling Wiz Lights.

> Any help, suggestions, or contributions are welcome. I'm just learning Rust, so I'm sure there are many things that could be improved.

The program will scan the network for Wiz Lights. You can then interface with them using the `Wiz` struct.

The project is still a work in progress. The idea is to implement as much functionality as possible from the Wiz local network API.
